# Mediapipe-rep-counter
Using media pipe machine learning model, I created a repetition counter(curls, squats) for basic gym app.
By calculating angle between 3 points we can estimate if exercise is done right and up the counter by 1 every rep.
There is a pose(hands straight up) to reset all counters.
